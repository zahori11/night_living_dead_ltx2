🎬 Technical Script: Sequence 01 - Radio Studio & Control Rooms

Production Details:
Engine: LTX-2 (via ComfyUI) 
Rendering Resolution (Native): 768x512 (Base resolution used to optimize the model’s VRAM memory usage).
Final Resolution (Export): Upscaled in post-production using the Upscale Image (or ImageScaleBy) node.
Director’s Note: The final scaling must be performed strictly using the nearest-exact method. This allows the video to be exported at higher resolutions (e.g., 1536x1024) by multiplying pixels as solid Lego-like blocks, avoiding bicubic smoothing and preserving the extreme sharpness of the 1-bit style.
Speed (Force Rate): 40 FPS
Visual Style: 1-bit Pixel Art (Monochrome: Black and White)
